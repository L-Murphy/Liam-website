            My name is Liam Murphy and I am a fifth year software engineering student at Carleton University. I will be graduating in January of 2022 and am looking for a job that starts in January.
            I enjoy working as part of a team to create products and solutions to a variety of problems. 
            When I'm not working I enjoy lifting weights, playing trading card games, and watching the Sens kick butt.

          I am currently attending Carleton University where I am taking Software Engineering. I have made the Dean's Honour List in each of the years that I have attended Carleton.
          As a student I learned how to work in a team with friends and strangers alike, how to take charge and when to follow other people's directions.
          I learned how to balance my school work and high achievements with a part time job and the ability to attend the occasional party with friends.

            I have many different passions and interests in my life. I love to stay active by lifting weights, biking, hiking, you name it!
            I also enjoy watching many different sports including hockey, football, basketball, and aussie rules football.
            Something I have spent too much time doing is playing trading card games such as hearthstone and pokemon. I enjoy the strategies behind them and how they allow me to 
            be competitive and also creative in the same medium.
